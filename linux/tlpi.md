# The Linux Programming Interface

## Preface

### Subject

This book describe the Linux programming interface--the system calls, library functions, and other low-level interfaces provided by Linux. This set of low-level interfaces is sometimes also know as the __system programming__ interface.

### About the author 

The author is a maintainer of the [__man-pages__](https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/) project.

## 2: Fundamental Concepts



## 3: System Programming Concepts



## 4: File I/O: The Universal I/O Model

### 4.1 Overview

All system calls for performing I/O refer to open files using a __file descriptor__. Everything is a file, including pipes, FIFOs, sockets, terminals, devices and regular files. Each **process** has its own set of file descriptors.

Three standard file descriptors: 0(stdin), 1(stdout), 2(stderr). The shell normally operates with these three file descriptors always open.

Four key system calls for performing file I/O:

* `fd = open(pathname, flags, mode)`
* `numread = read(fd, buffer, count)`
* `numwritten = write(fd, buffer, count)`
* `status = close(fd)`

### 4.2 Universality of I/O

Everything is a file.

### 4.3 Opening a file: _open()_
