# The Linux Programming Interface

## Preface

### Subject

This book describe the Linux programming interface--the system calls, library functions, and other low-level interfaces provided by Linux. This set of low-level interfaces is sometimes also know as the __system programming__ interface.

### About the author 

The author is a maintainer of the [__man-pages__](https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/) project.

## 3: System Programming Concepts

### 3.1 System Calls

A _system call_ is a controlled entry point into the kernel, allowing a process to request that the kernel perform some actions on the process's behalf.

* A system call changes the processor state from user mode to kernel mode
* The set of system calls is fixed. Each system call is identified by a unique number.
* Each system call may have a set of arguments that specify information to be transferred from user space to kernel space and vice versa.

More details about the steps in the execution of a system call, see the book. **I want to write a post for it**.

### 3.2 Library Functions

Some library functions make use of system calls, some do not.

### 3.3 The standard C library; The GNU C Library(_glibc_)

Ways to etermine the version of _glibc_ on the system.

### 3.4 Handling Errors from System Calls and Library Functions

It is good practice to check the status value indicating whether a call succeeds or fails.

When a system call fails, it sets the global integer variable _errno_ to a positive value that identifies the specific error.

The _perror()_ and _strerror()_ library functions can print error messages based on the _errno_ value.

### 3.6 Portability Issues

## 4: File I/O: The Universal I/O Model

### 4.1 Overview

All system calls for performing I/O refer to open files using a __file descriptor__. Everything is a file, including pipes, FIFOs, sockets, terminals, devices and regular files. Each **process** has its own set of file descriptors.

Three standard file descriptors: 0(stdin), 1(stdout), 2(stderr). The shell normally operates with these three file descriptors always open.

Four key system calls for performing file I/O:

* `fd = open(pathname, flags, mode)`
* `numread = read(fd, buffer, count)`
* `numwritten = write(fd, buffer, count)`
* `status = close(fd)`

### 4.2 Universality of I/O

Everything is a file.

### 4.3 Opening a file: _open()_

```c
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int open(const char *pathname, int flags, .../* mode_t mode */);
```

* _flag_ argument: specifies the _access mode_ for the file
* _mode_ argument: specifies the permissions to be placed on the file. If the _open()_ call does not specify `O_CREAT`, _mode_ can be ommited

An example:

```c
/* Open new or existing file for reading and writing, truncating to zero bytes; 
   file permissions read+write for owner, nothing for all others */
fd = open("my file", O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);

/* Open new or existing file for writing; 
   writes should always append to end of file */
fd = open("my file", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC | O_APPEND, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
```

### 4.4 Reading from a File: _read()_

A call to _read()_ may read **less** than the requested number of bytes. For a **regular** file, the probable reason for this is that we were close to the end of the file. When applied to pipes, FIFOs, sockets, or terminals--there are also various circumstances where it may read **fewer** bytes than requested.

### 4.5 Writing to a File: _write()_

A call to _write()_ may write **less** than the requested number of bytes.

### 4.6 Closing a file: _close()_

Closes an open file descriptor, freeing it for subsequent reuse by the process. When a process terminates, all its open file descriptors are automatically closed.

### 4.7 Changing the File Offset: _lseek()_

For each open file, the kernel maintains a _File offset_, which determines the location at which the next _read()_ or _write()_ will occur.

```
#include <unistd.h>

off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);
```

_whence_ can be set to `SEEK_SET`,`SEEK_CUR` and `SEEK_END`.

#### File holes

Seek past the end of a file, a call to _read()_ returns 0(EOF), and a call to _write()_ creates a _file hole_. Reading from holes return a buffer of null bytes(0).

File holes does not take up disk space. The file system does not allocate any disk blocks for a hole until, data is written into it later.

### 4.8 Operations Outside the Universal I/O Model: _ioctl()_

A general-purpose mechanism for performing file and device operations that fall outside the universal I/O model.
